**Flutter translations**

Use "input/translations.txt" input file to generate your translations for every language following the next example:

```
-EN:
hello
how are you
//apple
Pear
Welcome to   mexico

- ES:
hola
cómo estás
//manzana
pera
Bienvenido a mexico
```

The first language will always be the one that will be formatted to be used as the key for each translation
You can write comments using "//" in front of each line
You have to follow the order of the translations for each language.
